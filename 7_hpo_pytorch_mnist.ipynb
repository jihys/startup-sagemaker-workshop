    "MNIST is a widely used dataset for handwritten digit classification. It consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). This tutorial will show how to train and test an MNIST model on SageMaker using PyTorch. It also shows how to use SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning to select appropriate hyperparameters in order to get the best model. \n",

    "Now that we have prepared the dataset and the script, we are ready to train models. Before we do that, one thing to note is there are many hyperparameters that can dramtically affect the performance of the trained models. For example, learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc. Since which hyperparameter setting can lead to the best result depends on the dataset as well, it is almost impossible to pick the best hyperparameter setting without searching for it. Using SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning, we can create a hyperparameter tuning job to search for the best hyperparameter setting in an automated and effective way.\n",

    "In this example, we are using SageMaker Python SDK to set up and manage a hyperparameter tuning job. Specifically, we specify a range, or a list of possible values in the case of categorical hyperparameters, for each of the hyperparameter that we plan to tune. The hyperparameter tuning job will automatically launch multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter settings, evaluate results of those training jobs based on a predefined \"objective metric\", and select the hyperparameter settings for future attempts based on previous results. For each hyperparameter tuning job, we will give it a budget (max number of training jobs) and it will complete once that many training jobs have been executed.\n",

This creates a Sagemaker Endpoint -- a hosted prediction service that we can use to perform inference, based on the best model in the tuner. Remember in previous steps, the tuner launched multiple training jobs during tuning and the resulting model with the best objective metric is defined as the best model. \n",

    "\n",
    "The arguments to the deploy function allow us to set the number and type of instances that will be used for the Endpoint. These do not need to be the same as the values we used for the training job. For example, you can train a model on a set of GPU-based instances, and then deploy the Endpoint to a fleet of CPU-based instances, but you need to make sure that you return or save your model as a cpu model similar to what we did in `mnist.py`. Here we will deploy the model to a single ```ml.m4.xlarge``` instance."
